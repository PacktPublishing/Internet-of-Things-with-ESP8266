This is the code repository for [Internet of Things with ESP8266](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/internet-things-esp8266?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=Repository&utm_campaign=9781786468024) , published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

##Instructions and Navigation

The code included with this book is meant for use as an aid in performing the exercises and should not be used as a replacement for the book itself.
Used out of context, the code may result in an unusable configuration and no warranty is given.

The code will look like the following:
```
// Import required libraries
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>

void setup() {  

// Set GPIO 5 as output
pinMode(5, OUTPUT);
// Set GPIO 5 on a HIGH state
digitalWrite(5, HIGH);
}
void loop() {
}
```
